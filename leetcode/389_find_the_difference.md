# 389. Find the Difference - Easy

You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to `t`.

##### Example 1:

```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
```

##### Example 2:

```
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
```

##### Constraints:

- `0 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `t.length == s.length + 1`
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

```
# Time: O(n)
# Space: O(1)
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        return (set(Counter(t).items()) - set(Counter(s).items())).pop()[0]
```

## Notes
- Set difference.
- Not `O(m + n)` because we are told the strings are different in length by one character. Constant space because charsets are constant in size.
