# 348. Design Tic-Tac-Toe - Medium

Assume the following rules are for the tic-tac-toe game on an `n x n` board between two players:

- A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
- Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves are allowed.
- A player who succeeds in placing `n` of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

Implement the `TicTacToe` class:

- `TicTacToe(int n)` Initializes the object the size of the board `n`.
- `int move(int row, int col, int player)` Indicates that the player with id    player   plays at the cell `(row, col)` of the board. The move is guaranteed to be a valid move, and the two players alternate in making moves. Return
    - `0` if there is no winner after the move,
    - `1` if player 1 is the winner after the move, or
    - `2` if player 2 is the winner after the move.


##### Example 1:

```
Input
["TicTacToe", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move"]
[[3], [0, 0, 1], [0, 2, 2], [2, 2, 1], [1, 1, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 0, 2], [2, 1, 1]]
Output
[null, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

Explanation
TicTacToe ticTacToe = new TicTacToe(3);
Assume that player 1 is "X" and player 2 is "O" in the board.
ticTacToe.move(0, 0, 1); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| | |
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (0, 0).
| | | |

ticTacToe.move(0, 2, 2); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 2 makes a move at (0, 2).
| | | |

ticTacToe.move(2, 2, 1); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 2).
| | |X|

ticTacToe.move(1, 1, 2); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 1).
| | |X|

ticTacToe.move(2, 0, 1); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 0).
|X| |X|

ticTacToe.move(1, 0, 2); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 0).
|X| |X|

ticTacToe.move(2, 1, 1); // return 1Â (player 1 wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 1).
|X|X|X|
```

##### Constraints:

- `2 <= n <= 100`
- player is `1` or `2`.
- `0 <= row, col < n`
- `(row, col)` are unique for each different call to move.
- At most <code>n<sup>2</sup></code> calls will be made to move.

Follow-up: Could you do better than <code>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</code> per `move()` operation?

## Solution

```
# Overall Space: O(n)
class TicTacToe:
    UP, DOWN = 0, 1
    P1, P2 = 1, 2
    
    # Time: O(n)
    def __init__(self, n: int):
        self.rows = [0] * n
        self.cols = [0] * n
        self.diags = [0] * 2
        self.n = n
        
    # Time: O(1)
    def move(self, row: int, col: int, player: int) -> int:
        step = 1 if player == self.P1 else -1
        self.rows[row] += step
        self.cols[col] += step
        if row == col:
            self.diags[self.DOWN] += step
        if row + col == self.n - 1:
            self.diags[self.UP] += step
        
        lines = [self.rows[row], 
                 self.cols[col],
                 self.diags[self.UP], 
                 self.diags[self.DOWN]]
        if self.n in [abs(score) for score in lines]:
            return player
        return 0
```

## Notes
- Fairly straightforward because we don't have to worry about determining when there cannot possibly be a winner after a move. We can represent different player moves by incrementing/decrementing scores for particular rows/cols/diags; with this system scores for rows/cols/diags will only reach `n` when one player has taken up the entire row/col/diag. Note how diags are handled; there are only `2` possible diagonals, up and down, and for the up diagonal cells that belong to it sum to `n - 1`; similary for the down diagonal the row and col indices equal each other.
