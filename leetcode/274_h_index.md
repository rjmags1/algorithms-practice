# 274. H-Index - Medium

Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their `ith` paper, return compute the researcher's `h-index`.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: A scientist has an index `h` if `h` of their `n` papers have at least `h` citations each, and the other `n âˆ’ h` papers have no more than `h` citations each.

If there are several possible values for `h`, the maximum one is taken as the `h`-index.

##### Example 1:

```
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
```

##### Example 2:

```
Input: citations = [1,3,1]
Output: 1
```

##### Constraints:

- `n == citations.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5000`
- `0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`

## Solution

```
# Time: O(nlog(n))
# Space: O(n) for python timsort
class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:
        citations.sort()
        n = len(citations)
        for i in reversed(range(n)):
            cites = citations[i]
            h = n - i
            if h > cites:
                return h - 1
                
        return n
```

## Notes
- Be careful with this one and walk through an example. We want the largest 1-index where the index is greater than or equal to the citations of the paper at that index, if the input is sorted in descending order. This represents the largest number of papers `h` for which the researcher has at least `h` citations.
